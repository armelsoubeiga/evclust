Various clustering algorithms that produce a credal partition, i.e., a set of Dempster-Shafer mass functions representing the membership of objects to clusters. The mass functions quantify the cluster-membership uncertainty of the objects. The algorithms are: Evidential c-Means, Relational Evidential c-Means, Constrained Evidential c-Means, Multiples Relational Evidential c-Means.

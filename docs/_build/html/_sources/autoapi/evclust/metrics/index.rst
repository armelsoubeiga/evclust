evclust.metrics
===============

.. py:module:: evclust.metrics

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module contains the metrics functions using to evaluate credal results





Module Contents
---------------

.. py:function:: build_matrices(F)

.. py:function:: pairwise_mass(clus)

   Computes relational representations for credal partition such as generated by a credal method.


.. py:function:: credalRI(clus1, clus2)

   Computes generalizations of the Rand index to compare credal partitions.

   Parameters :
   ------------
   clus1:
       Relational representation of the first credal partition such as generated by a credal method.
   clus2:
       Relational representation of the second credal partition such as generated by a credal method.

   Returns :
   ---------
   RI (float):
       Credal Rand indices.

   References:
   -----------
       In Denoeux et al. (2018), two generalizations of the Rand index for comparing credal partitions
       are defined: one is based on distances between mass function, the other one is based on distances.


.. py:function:: nonspecificity(mass, F)

   Compute the nonspecificity of a credal partition.

   :param mass ( ndarray (n: The credal partition.
   :param F size)): The credal partition.
   :param F (array): The array of length of focalsets.

   :returns: The nonspecificity of the credal partition.
   :rtype: NS (float)

   Evidential c-means algorithm. `ecm` Computes a credal partition from a matrix of attribute data using the Evidential c-means (ECM) algorithm.

   ECM is an evidential version algorithm of the Hard c-Means (HCM) and Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) algorithms.
   As in HCM and FCM, each cluster is represented by a prototype. However, in ECM, some sets of clusters
   are also represented by a prototype, which is defined as the center of mass of the prototypes in each
   individual cluster. The algorithm iteratively optimizes a cost function, with respect to the prototypes
   and to the credal partition. By default, each mass function in the credal partition has 2^c focal sets,
   where c is the supplied number of clusters. We can also limit the number of focal sets to subsets of
   clusters with cardinalities 0, 1 and c (recommended if c>=10), or to all or some selected pairs of clusters.
   If initial prototypes g0 are provided, the number of trials is automatically set to 1.

   Parameters:
   ----------
   x:
       input matrix of size n x d, where n is the number of objects and d is the number of attributes.
   c:
       Number of clusters.
   g0:
       Initial prototypes, matrix of size c x d. If not supplied, the prototypes are initialized randomly.
   type:
       Type of focal sets ("simple": empty set, singletons and Omega; "full": all 2^c subsets of Omega;
           "pairs": empty set, singletons, Omega, and all or selected pairs).
   pairs:
       Set of pairs to be included in the focal sets; if None, all pairs are included. Used only if type="pairs".
   Omega:
       Logical. If True (default), the whole frame is included (for types 'simple' and 'pairs').
   ntrials (int):
       Number of runs of the optimization algorithm (set to 1 if g0 is supplied).
   alpha (float):
       Exponent of the cardinality in the cost function.
   beta (float):
       Exponent of masses in the cost function.
   delta (float):
       Distance to the empty set.
   epsi (float):
       Minimum amount of improvement.
   init (str):
       Initialization: "kmeans" (default) or "rand" (random).
   disp (bool):
       If True (default), intermediate results are displayed.

   Returns:
   --------
   The credal partition (an object of class "credpart").
